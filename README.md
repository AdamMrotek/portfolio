## Main Goals in mind
  The project was meant to be an introduction to Sass, and in the process expand to be a styling process itself. The portfolio was built only with Sass and HTML. Thanks to external mail sending API, which processes post forms, I was able to build a fully functional and slightly animated page, that can be viewed on widescreen monitors and mobile devices. That was the first project which I build for myself using firefox "dev tools", "can I use", adding a few performance improvements and a wide range of selectors, pseudo-selectors, and pseudo-classes.
